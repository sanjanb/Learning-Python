### **Code: `game.py`**

```python
import random

def main():
    level = get_positive_integer("Level: ")
    secret_number = random.randint(1, level)
    play_game(secret_number)


def get_positive_integer(prompt):
    """
    Prompt the user for a positive integer.

    Args:
        prompt (str): The prompt to display to the user.

    Returns:
        int: A positive integer entered by the user.
    """
    while True:
        try:
            value = int(input(prompt))
            if value > 0:
                return value
        except ValueError:
            pass
        print("Invalid input. Please enter a positive integer.")

        if guess < secret_number:
            print("Too small!")
        elif guess > secret_number:
            print("Too large!")
        else:
            print("Just right!")
            break


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

### **Explanation with What, Why, and How**

---

#### 1. **Imports**
```python
import random
```

- **What?**
  - The `random` module provides functions for generating random numbers.

- **Why?**
  - The game requires a randomly generated secret number between `1` and the user-specified `level`.

- **How?**
  - `random.randint(a, b)` generates a random integer between `a` and `b`, inclusive.

---

#### 2. **Main Function**
```python
def main():
    level = get_positive_integer("Level: ")
    secret_number = random.randint(1, level)
    play_game(secret_number)
```

- **What?**
  - Orchestrates the game:
    1. Prompts the user for a level.
    2. Generates a random number between `1` and the given level.
    3. Calls `play_game()` to start the guessing game.

- **Why?**
  - Ensures the program flow is well-structured and modular.

- **How?**
  - Each task is delegated to separate helper functions (`get_positive_integer` and `play_game`) for better organization.

---

#### 3. **Getting a Positive Integer**
```python
def get_positive_integer(prompt):
    """
    Prompt the user for a positive integer.

    Args:
        prompt (str): The prompt to display to the user.

    Returns:
        int: A positive integer entered by the user.
    """
    while True:
        try:
            value = int(input(prompt))
            if value > 0:
                return value
        except ValueError:
            pass
        print("Invalid input. Please enter a positive integer.")
```

- **What?**
  - Continuously prompts the user until they enter a valid positive integer.

- **Why?**
  - Ensures robust input validation:
    - Rejects non-integer inputs.
    - Rejects non-positive numbers (e.g., `-1`, `0`).

- **How?**
  - Uses a `while True` loop to repeatedly prompt the user until valid input is provided.
  - Catches `ValueError` if the user enters a non-integer.
  - Prints an error message for invalid inputs.

---

#### 4. **Playing the Game**
```python
def play_game(secret_number):
    """
    Play the guessing game with the user.

    Args:
        secret_number (int): The randomly generated number the user must guess.
    """
    while True:
        guess = get_positive_integer("Guess: ")

        if guess < secret_number:
            print("Too small!")
        elif guess > secret_number:
            print("Too large!")
        else:
            print("Just right!")
            break
```

- **What?**
  - Continuously prompts the user to guess the secret number until they guess correctly.

- **Why?**
  - Provides feedback for each guess:
    - If the guess is too small, the user knows to guess higher.
    - If the guess is too large, the user knows to guess lower.
    - If the guess is correct, the game ends.

- **How?**
  - Uses a `while True` loop to repeatedly prompt for guesses.
  - Compares the user's guess to the secret number and provides appropriate feedback.
  - Exits the loop when the user guesses correctly.

---

#### 5. **Running the Program**
```python
if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

- **What?**
  - Ensures the `main()` function runs only when the script is executed directly.

- **Why?**
  - Prevents unintended execution if the script is imported as a module in another program.

- **How?**
  - Python sets the `__name__` variable to `"__main__"` when the script is executed directly.

---

### **Output Examples**

1. **Valid Level and Correct Guess**
   ```bash
   Level: 10
   Guess: 5
   Too small!
   Guess: 7
   Too small!
   Guess: 10
   Just right!
   ```

2. **Invalid Level**
   ```bash
   Level: cat
   Invalid input. Please enter a positive integer.
   Level: -5
   Invalid input. Please enter a positive integer.
   Level: 20
   Guess: 15
   ```

3. **Invalid Guess**
   ```bash
   Level: 10
   Guess: -3
   Invalid input. Please enter a positive integer.
   Guess: cat
   Invalid input. Please enter a positive integer.
   Guess: 8
   ```

---

### **Why This Implementation?**

1. **Readability**: Clear and modular code with descriptive function names.
2. **Robust Input Validation**: Handles invalid inputs gracefully.
3. **Reusability**: The `get_positive_integer` function is reusable for any input requiring a positive integer.
4. **User-Friendly**: Provides clear prompts and feedback to guide the user through the game.

---

### **Testing**

- **Test Cases**
  - Valid levels: Ensure the program accepts positive integers.
  - Invalid levels: Ensure the program rejects non-integer and non-positive inputs.
  - Guesses:
    - Too small.
    - Too large.
    - Just right.
  - Edge cases:
    - Level = 1 (only one possible number).
