## üìò Key Concepts Learned

### Python Basics
- Variables, data types (`int`, `str`, `list`, etc.), and basic input/output.
- Arithmetic and comparison operators.

### Control Flow
- Decision-making with `if-elif-else`.
- Loops: Iterating with `for` and `while`.

### Functions
- Writing reusable functions with parameters.
- Using return statements for outputs.

### Modules & Libraries
- Importing and using built-in libraries.
- Exploring third-party libraries like `pyfiglet` and `emoji`.

> **How to Update**: Add bullet points for each major topic or concept you learn. This will help you quickly review your progress.

## üèÜ Tips for Tracking Progress

1. **Daily Updates**:
   - Set aside 5‚Äì10 minutes daily to log your progress in the `Progress Tracker`.
   - Include the date, topic, and a brief summary of what you learned or practiced.
   
2. **Weekly Reviews**:
   - Summarize the key concepts learned during the week in the "Key Concepts Learned" section.
   - Reflect on what went well and what could be improved.

3. **Mini-Projects**:
   - Use small exercises or projects to solidify your understanding of a concept.
   - Add these to the "Mini-Projects" section once completed.

4. **Stay Flexible**:
   - It's okay to adjust your goals. Use the "Future Goals" section to keep yourself inspired and on track.

5. **Version Control**:
   - Use Git to commit your changes regularly. This will also track your coding progress and create a version history of your learning.
